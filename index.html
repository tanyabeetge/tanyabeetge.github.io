            <h3>My background</h3>
            <p>I am not a professional web designer or trained developer. However, I have extensive
                experience in related fields and was awarded merit-based scholarship and worked as a
                graduate assistant my time at university. </p>

            <p>I take inspiration from Beckett’s <cite>Trilogy</cite>: </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p> The fact would seem to be, if in my situation one may speak of facts, not only
                    that I shall have to speak of things of which I cannot speak, but also, which is
                    even more interesting, but also that I, which is if possible even more
                    interesting, that I shall have to, I forget, no matter. <br /> (Samuel Beckett)
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If I were to point to one thing that really sets it apart from everyone else in the
                world would be my ability to remember the things that are important and forget the
                things really bug me.</p>

            <h3>My Process</h3>
            <p> Over the years, I have developed a thorough process for the analysis, design, and
                creation of material being posted on the web. In my process, I take the following
                steps: </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify</strong> – to ensure that both the needs and the expectations
                    of the client are met</li>
                <li><strong>Investigate</strong> – in-depth research, exploration and examination of
                    the client’s needs</li>
                <li><strong>Integrate</strong> – determining the project’s place within the overall
                    marketing strategy of the client</li>
                <li><strong>Illustrate</strong> – draft and display and revise sample layouts and
                    interfaces</li>
            </ol>
